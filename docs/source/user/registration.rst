Registration
============



To start using a slidge-whatsapp, you need to register your XMPP account with it.
The instance has a unique XMPP (aka JID) address, which is just a domain name (e.g., ``whatsapp.example.org``, without any @ sign in it).

There are two ways to register, depending on which XMPP/Jabber client you are using:

- If your client supports adhoc commands (such as Movim, Gajim, or Cheogram),
  you can use the "Register" command with the slidge-whatsapp instance's
  address.
- If your client does not support adhoc commands (such as Conversations), you
  can register by sending a text message that says "register" to the
  slidge-whatsapp instance's address.
